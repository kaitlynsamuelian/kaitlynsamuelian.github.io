      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>Pink is the color[2] of a namesake flower that is a pale tint of red.[3][4] It was first
      used as a color name in the late 17th century.[5] According to surveys in Europe
      and the United States, pink is the color most often associated with charm, politeness,
      sensitivity, tenderness, sweetness, childhood, femininity, and romance. A combination of
      pink and white is associated with innocence, whereas a combination of pink and black
      links to eroticism and seduction.[6] In the 21st century, pink is seen as a symbol of
      femininity, though it has not always been seen this way. In the 1920s, light red,
      which is similar to pink, was seen as a color that reflected masculinity.[7]</p>
