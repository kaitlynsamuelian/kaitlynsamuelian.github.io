                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>Pink is the color[2] of a namesake flower that is a pale tint of red.[3][4] It was first
                    used as a color name in the late 17th century.[5] According to surveys in Europe
                    and the United States, pink is the color most often associated with charm, politeness,
                    sensitivity, tenderness, sweetness, childhood, femininity, and romance. A combination of
                    pink and white is associated with innocence, whereas a combination of pink and black
                    links to eroticism and seduction.[6] In the 21st century, pink is seen as a symbol of
                    femininity, though it has not always been seen this way. In the 1920s, light red,
                    which is similar to pink, was seen as a color that reflected masculinity.[7]</p>

                <h3>Etymology and definitions</h3>
                <p>The color pink is named after the flowers, pinks,[8] flowering plants in the genus Dianthus, and
                    derives from the frilled edge of the flowers. The verb "to pink" dates from the 14th century and
                    means "to decorate with a perforated or punched pattern" (possibly from German picken, "to
                    peck").[9] It has survived to the current day in pinking shears, hand-held scissors that cut a
                    zig-zagged line to prevent fraying.</p>

                    <h4>Optics</h4>
                    <p>In optics, the word "pink" can refer to any of the pale shades of colors between bluish red to
                        red in
                        hue, of medium to high lightness, and of low to moderate saturation.Although pink is generally
                        considered a tint of red,the colors of most tints of pink are slightly bluish, and lie
                        between red and magenta. A few variations of pink, such as salmon color, lean toward orange.</p>

                    <h4>Sunrises and Sunsets</h4>
                    <p>As a ray of white sunlight travels through the atmosphere, some of the colors are scattered out
                        of
                        the beam by air molecules and airborne particles. This is called Rayleigh scattering. Colors
                        with a
                        shorter wavelength, such as blue and green, scatter more strongly, and are removed from the
                        light
                        that finally reaches the eye.At sunrise and sunset, when the path of the sunlight through the
                        atmosphere to the eye is longest, the blue and green components are removed almost completely,
                        leaving the longer wavelength orange, red and pink light. The remaining pinkish sunlight can
                        also be
                        scattered by cloud droplets and other relatively large particles, which give the sky above the
                        horizon a pink or reddish glow.</p>

                    <h4>Common associations and popularity</h4>
                    <p>According to public opinion surveys in Europe and the United States, pink is the color most
                        associated with charm, politeness, sensitivity, tenderness, sweetness, softness, childhood, the
                        feminine, and the romantic.Although it did not have any strong negative associations in
                        these surveys, few respondents chose pink as their favorite color. Pink was the favorite color
                        of only two percent of respondents.There was a notable difference between men and women in
                        regards to a preference for pink; three percent of women chose pink as their favorite color,
                        compared with less than one percent of men. Many of the men surveyed were unable to even
                        identify pink correctly, confusing it with mauve. Pink was also more popular with older people
                        than younger.</p>
                    <p>In Japan, pink is the color most commonly associated with springtime due to the blooming cherry
                        blossoms.[40][41] This is different from surveys in the United States and Europe where green is
                        the color most associated with springtime.</p>

                        <li><strong>In the pink</strong>. To be in top form, in good health, in good condition. In Romeo
                            and Juliet,
                            Mercutio says; "I am the very pink of courtesy." Romeo: Pink for flower? Mercutio: Right.
                            Romeo: Then my pump is well flowered."</li>
                        <li><strong>To see pink elephants</strong> means to hallucinate from alcoholism. The expression
                            was used by
                            American novelist Jack London in his book John Barleycorn in 1913.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pink slip</strong>. To be given a pink slip means to be fired or dismissed from a
                            job. It was first
                            recorded in 1915 in the United States.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tickled pink</strong>means extremely pleased.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Pink Tax</strong>refers to the invisible price women must pay for goods that are

                            advertised specifically for them. It is the tendency for products targeted specifically
                            toward women to be more expensive than those targeted toward men.</li>

                    <h4>Food and beverages</h4>
                    <p>
                        According to surveys in Europe and the United States, pink is the color most associated with
                        sweet foods and beverages. Pink is also one of the few colors to be strongly associated with a
                        particular aroma, that of roses.[45] Many strawberry and raspberry-flavored foods are colored
                        pink and light red as well, sometimes to distinguish them from cherry-flavored foods that are
                        more commonly colored dark red (although raspberry-flavored foods, particularly in the United
                        States, are often colored blue as well). The drink Tab was packaged in pink cans, presumably to
                        subconsciously convey a sweet taste.

                    <p>
                        The pink color in most packaged and processed foods, ice creams, candies and pastries is made
                        with artificial food coloring. The most common pink food coloring is erythrosine, also known as
                        Red No. 3, an organoiodine compound, a derivative of fluorone, which is a cherry-pink
                        synthetic.[46] It is usually listed on package labels as E-127. Another common red or pink
                        (particularly in the United States where erythrosine is less frequently used) is Allura Red AC
                        (E-129), also known as Red No. 40. Some products use a natural red or pink food coloring,
                        Cochineal, also called carmine, made with crushed insects of the family Dactylopius coccus.
