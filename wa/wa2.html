      <strong>Description of myself</strong> I'm still trying to figure out which field of engineering
      I'm interested in most, but overall im really happy I'm taking some core classes(web, image, etc)
      this semester to find out. Other than that, some things I love are music, food,
      going to the gym and hanging out with friends and family (my dog too of course).
