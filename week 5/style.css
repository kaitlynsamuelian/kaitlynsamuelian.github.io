 3 more comments at the bottom of the CSS file to indicate styles specific:

 1)to the setup of the card container: Give the main card container a fixed width/height, solid background color,
border, and border-radius (rounded corners!), amongst other things.

 2)styles specific to the header and footer:
 -Give the header a background gradient that goes from darker to lighter, rounded corners that fit in with the rounded corners set on the main card container. 
 -Give the footer a background gradient that goes from lighter to darker, rounded corners that fit in with the rounded corners set on the main card container.

 3)and styles specific to the main business card contents:
 -Float the image to the right so that it sticks to the right-hand side of the main business card contents, and
give it a max-height of 100% (a clever trick that ensures that it will grow/shrink to stay the same height as its parent container, regardless of what height it becomes.)
